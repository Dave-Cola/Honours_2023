#My next step was to isolate the duplex calls from the dorado basecalled data which includes both simplex and duplex basecalled data.
#This was done in order to examine the proportion of reads that were duplex and to potentially use this data set for Verkko.
#Since the output of dorado is a Bam file, i first convereted this to a fastQ format using samtools
$ grep -A 3 "dx:i:1" Wdx_PYduplex.fq | grep -v '^ *-- *$' > JustPYduplex.fq
# The "dx:i:1" is a header tag that indicates the record is a duplex read, while "dx:i:0" indicates simplex. This grep find all the headers with the duplex tag and then takes 3 lines of trailing context which inlcudes the base sequence, + line and the base qaulity sequence.
#The Next Grep removess all the liness with -- because these are inserted between all the grep hits.
#Using nanoplot I generated a general summary for just the duplex basecalls.
$ NanoPlot -t 4 --fastq JustPYduplex.fq
